```

## üîç How It Works

AgentCLI operates in a sophisticated think-act-observe loop, leveraging Google's Gemini API to accomplish tasks autonomously with remarkable precision and adaptability.

### Think-Act-Observe Loop

#### 1. Think

In the thinking phase, AgentCLI:

- Analyzes the user's request and current context
- Considers available tools and previous observations
- Formulates a plan of action with specific steps
- Anticipates potential challenges and prepares fallback strategies

The agent leverages Gemini's advanced reasoning capabilities to understand context, identify required steps, and develop an optimal execution strategy.

#### 2. Act

In the action phase, AgentCLI:

- Executes a specific action from its repertoire of capabilities
- Provides precise parameters derived from the thinking phase
- Handles complex operations with appropriate error handling
- Manages resources efficiently for long-running operations

The agent can perform 17+ different actions, from simple file operations to complex web interactions and code execution.

#### 3. Observe

In the observation phase, AgentCLI:

- Captures the results of the executed action
- Analyzes success or failure conditions
- Updates its understanding of the environment
- Stores observations in memory for future reference

This critical feedback loop allows the agent to adapt to unexpected outcomes, recover from errors, and refine its approach for subsequent actions.

### Memory System

AgentCLI maintains a comprehensive memory system that tracks:

- Conversation history with the user
- File operations and their results
- Web browsing state and screenshots
- Command execution history and outputs
- Code execution results and outputs

This memory system allows the agent to build context across multiple interactions, refer back to previous actions, and make informed decisions based on the evolving state of the environment.

### Workflow Example

```
User Input ‚Üí Agent Thinking ‚Üí Action Execution ‚Üí Observation ‚Üí Agent Thinking ‚Üí ...
```

For example, when asked to "Create a Python script that fetches weather data":

1. **Think**: The agent analyzes the request, determines it needs to create a file with Python code that uses a weather API.
2. **Act**: The agent executes `CREATE_FILE` with appropriate filename and content parameters.
3. **Observe**: The agent captures the result (file created successfully) and updates its memory.
4. **Think**: The agent considers what to do next, perhaps suggesting to run the script or modify it.

This loop continues until the task is completed or the agent encounters an insurmountable obstacle.

## üõ† Technical Architecture

AgentCLI is built with a modular, extensible architecture designed for performance, reliability, and ease of use.

### Core Components

#### LLM Integration

AgentCLI integrates with Google's Gemini API through a robust client that handles:

- API authentication and request formatting
- Response parsing and error handling
- Streaming responses for improved user experience
- Caching to reduce API calls and improve performance

The integration is designed to be resilient to API changes and to handle rate limiting gracefully.

#### Memory System

The memory system consists of several components:

- **Conversation Memory**: Stores the history of user inputs and agent responses
- **File Memory**: Tracks file operations and maintains metadata about files
- **Browser Memory**: Stores the current state of web browsing sessions
- **Execution Memory**: Records command and code execution history and results

Memory can be persisted across sessions using the optional memory server, allowing for long-running interactions.

#### Action Framework

The action framework provides a unified interface for all agent capabilities:

- **Action Parser**: Parses action strings into structured commands
- **Action Executor**: Routes actions to appropriate handlers
- **Action Handlers**: Implement specific functionality for each action type
- **Result Formatter**: Formats action results for observation

This modular design makes it easy to add new actions or modify existing ones without changing the core loop.

#### Web Integration

Web integration is provided through a Puppeteer-based server that enables:

- Headless web browsing with full JavaScript support
- Screenshot capture of entire pages or specific elements
- JavaScript execution in the browser context
- Web search capabilities

### Advanced Features

The file diff feature allows you to compare two files and visualize the differences between them. This is particularly useful for:

- Comparing different versions of configuration files
- Reviewing code changes
- Identifying differences between data exports

The diff output is colorized and formatted for easy reading, with additions, deletions, and changes clearly marked.

### Code Execution Sandbox

AgentCLI can execute Python and JavaScript code in a controlled environment:

- **Python Execution**: Run Python code with full access to standard libraries
- **JavaScript Execution**: Execute JavaScript in the browser context when web browsing is enabled

Code execution is performed in a sandboxed environment with configurable timeouts and resource limits to prevent runaway processes.

### Clipboard Integration

The clipboard integration feature allows AgentCLI to interact with the system clipboard:

- **Copy to Clipboard**: Copy text to the system clipboard for use in other applications
- **Get from Clipboard**: Retrieve text from the system clipboard for use in AgentCLI

This feature is particularly useful for transferring data between AgentCLI and other applications.

### Text Summarization

The text summarization feature uses the Gemini API to condense long text into concise summaries while preserving key information. This is useful for:

- Summarizing articles or documentation
- Extracting key points from long discussions
- Creating executive summaries of reports

### Progress Tracking

Yes, AgentCLI is designed to be extensible. You can add custom actions by:

1. Implementing a new method in the `AgentCLI` class
2. Adding the action to the system prompt
3. Adding parsing logic to the `execute_action` method

The modular design makes it easy to add new capabilities without modifying the core loop. See the [Contributing](#-contributing) section for more information on how to contribute to the project.

### What operating systems are supported?

AgentCLI is designed to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It includes platform-specific adaptations for features like clipboard operations and terminal handling to ensure a consistent experience across different operating systems.

The agent automatically detects your operating system and adjusts its behavior accordingly, such as using the appropriate command syntax and file path conventions. This cross-platform compatibility makes it a versatile tool for developers working in mixed environments.

### How is performance optimized in AgentCLI?

AgentCLI 2.0 includes several performance optimizations to ensure smooth operation even with complex tasks:

- Response caching reduces API calls by storing and reusing responses for similar queries
- Parallel processing enables multi-threaded execution for long-running operations
- Progress tracking with tqdm provides visual feedback for time-consuming tasks
- Streaming responses from the API allows for faster initial response times
- Memory pruning prevents excessive memory usage during long sessions
- Configurable timeouts prevent operations from hanging indefinitely

These optimizations make AgentCLI responsive and efficient, even when handling resource-intensive tasks like file searches across large codebases or complex web interactions.
